# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Assignment - ReactJS app.

Name: Kathleen McCarthy Kelleher

## Overview.

...... State the app concept and objectives. If it's the Movies Fan app extension, only state the additional objectives .........


...... A bullet-point list of user features. If it's the Movies Fan app extension, only list new/modified features...... 
 
 + Feature 1
 + Feature 2
 + Feature 3
 + etc
 + etc

## Setup requirements.

...... A brief explanation (to a third party) of any non-standard setup steps necessary to run your app/client locally (after cloning the repo) ........

## API Data Model.

..... [For non-Movies Fan app] Insert a diagram of the API's data model (see example below) AND/OR a sample(s) of the JSON documents returned by its endpoints ........

![][model]

......[For the Movies Fan app] Specify the additional TMDB endpoints used and show sample responses, in JSON .........

## App Design.

### Component catalogue.

....... Insert a screenshot from the Storybook UI showing your component catalogue. [For the Movies app, hi-light stories relating to new/modified components - see the example screenshot below] .......

![][stories]

### UI Design.

...... Insert screenshots of the app's views, with appropriate captions (see example below). (For the Movies Fan App, only show the new/modified views) ........

![][view]
>Shows detailed information on a movie. Clicking the 'Reviews' floating action button will display extracts from critic reviews.

### Routing.

...... Insert a list of the routes supported by your app and state the associated view. If relevant, specify which of the routes require authentication, i.e. protected/private. [For the Movies Fan app, only new routes should be listed.] ......... 

+ GET /blogs - displays all published blogs.
+ POST /blogs (protected) - add a new blog.
+ GET /blogs/:id - displays a particular blog.
+ GET /blogs/:id/comments (protected) - detail view of a particular blog and its comments.
+ etc.
+ etc.

## Independent learning (If relevant).

....... Briefly state any technologies/techniques used in your project codebase that was not covered in the lectures/labs. Provide source code filename (source code excerpts are not required in most cases) references to support your assertions and include references (articles/blogs) .........
